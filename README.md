Song Player App is a Java-based application that demonstrates the basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOPs) by implementing a simple song player with support for managing songs and albums. The app provides a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with their music library and perform basic operations such as adding songs, creating albums, and playing songs from albums.

Features:

Song Management: Users can add songs to their music library by providing details such as title, artist, genre, and duration. Each song is represented as an object with properties, and users can view, update, and delete songs in their library.

Album Creation: Users can create albums and add songs to them. Albums are implemented as objects that contain a list of songs, and users can add, remove, and view songs within an album.

Playback Controls: Users can play songs from albums, view the details of the currently playing song, and control playback with basic operations such as play, pause, stop, and skip.

Search and Sorting: Users can search for songs based on title, artist, or genre, and sort songs by various criteria such as title, artist, or duration. These functionalities are implemented using OOPs concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance, providing a basic understanding of how OOPs principles can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Error Handling: The app incorporates error handling mechanisms using exception handling, ensuring that any errors or exceptions that occur during runtime are properly handled, and the app remains stable and user-friendly.

Technologies Used:

Java: The app is developed using Java, a popular and versatile programming language known for its platform independence, scalability, and robustness.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concepts: The app utilizes key OOPs concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to design a modular and extensible codebase.

Command-Line Interface (CLI): The app provides a simple CLI for users to interact with their music library and perform basic operations.

Data Structures: The app uses data structures such as arrays and lists to efficiently manage and manipulate the songs and albums.

Usage:

Clone or download the JavaSongPlayerApp repository from GitHub.

Compile and run the Java code to launch the app.

Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the app, such as adding songs, creating albums, and playing songs from albums.
